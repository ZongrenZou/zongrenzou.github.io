<h1>Zongren Zou</h1>
<p>This is my homepage, for now. I'm new to html programming, so I can't really make it look smart. I can't even know how to add Chineses charactor here. But this is interesting.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm from Beijing, China. I was born in Peixian, Jiangsu, China and my family and I moved to Beijing when I was 6. Before that I lived in Tianjin for 3 years, attending kindergarden, and before that I was in a small town, named Weimiao, in Peixian, Jiangsu. When I'm in U.S.A., people always know I come from China and they don't care which province or which city; when I'm in Beijing, I like saying I come from Peixian Jiangsu, because it's interesting for me to say I'm not local while I am; when I'm in other places in China, or hanging out with friends from China, people always know I'm from Beijing because I have strong Beijing accent.</p>
<h2>Laptop</h2>
<p>I'm holding an XPS 15 with 7700HQ CPU, NVIDIA 1050 graphics card and 1080p screen.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>Qiyi Elementary School, to Capital Normal University High School, to Peking University, to Harvard University, to Duke University or Brown University (undecided yet)</p>
